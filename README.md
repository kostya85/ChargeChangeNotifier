# ChargeChangeNotifier
The Charge Change Notifier app helps you charge your device!  If your phone or tablet suddenly disconnects from the wall outlet or the cable breaks and charging stops, you will immediately receive notification about it. You can also turn on the notification when the device starts charging!
